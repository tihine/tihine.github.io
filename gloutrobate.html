            <h2>School project</h2>
            <p>The aim of this two-person school project was to design a game in C++, based on adjectives chosen at random. We chose glutton ("glouton" in french) and acrobat ("acrobate" in french), hence the name of the game.</p>
            <p>From these 2 adjectives, we chose to design a platformer. The adjective acrobat led us directly to think of a platformer for its movement mechanics and the objective of moving through the platforms in an agile way.</p>
            <p>To add the 'glutton' aspect, we came up with the idea of adding little cakes to the levels. The most gluttonous player, the one who collects the most cakes, is the winner. </p>
            <p>To add interest to the game, some cakes give the player bonuses: jump higher, move faster, etc.</p>
